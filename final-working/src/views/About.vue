          Playing cards were invented in Imperial China. They were found in China as early as the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty (618â€“907). Playing cards first entered Southern Europe in the 14th century, probably from Mamluk Egypt, using the Mamluk suits of cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks, and which are still used in traditional Latin decks.

          I grew up playing cards with my mom and have always had an affinity for the different designs and themes that decks can feature. Over the years I have collected this selection of cards because I enjoyed the designs or wanted to bring home a memory of a trip. Now, these decks remind me of different times, people, and places in my life, and I also use them practically to play games with friends and family.
