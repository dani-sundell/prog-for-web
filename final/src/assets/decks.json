The tuck case, and the cards within, are all made in the USA on FSC-certified, ECF paper. Secret imagery is hidden within the design: the lines of the inner flap construct (literally!) a face of mystery. Every single playing card within the Contraband deck was designed from scratch - even the Aces, Jokers, and court cards display attention to detail never before achieved. Over a year in the making - and every minute of it is visible in the final design."

These unique cards, with their colorful design and patterns, will bring fun to any gathering. The package also includes a mini booklet with history and lore, game instruction, and information about the artists. Playing cards were invented in Imperial China. They were found in China as early as the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). Playing cards first entered Southern Europe in the 14th century, probably from Mamluk Egypt, using the Mamluk suits of cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks, and which are still used in traditional Latin decks."
